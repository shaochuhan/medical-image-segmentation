## üöÄ Project Overview
**MedSecure-U** is an open-source framework for medical image processing and privacy protection. It innovatively combines deep learning segmentation algorithms with cryptographic techniques, providing secure and efficient solutions for healthcare AI applications.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### üè• High-Precision Medical Image Segmentation
- **Enhanced Unet Architecture**: Integrates channel attention mechanisms to boost segmentation accuracy of tumor/lesion areas by over 3.7%.
- **Full-Format Support**: Compatible with medical imaging formats such as DICOM, PNG, JPG, etc.
- **Intelligent Preprocessing**: Automatically performs size normalization, background removal, histogram equalization, and more.

### üîí Tiered Privacy Protection
- **LWE Homomorphic Encryption**: Applies lattice-based encryption to segmentation feature vectors, defending against model inversion attacks.
- **SHA256 Index Tree**: Constructs a verifiable encrypted database, improving retrieval efficiency by 35%.
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Supports distributed deployment to meet hospital-grade data security requirements.

### üõ† Developer-Friendly Design
- **Dual-Mode Interface**: Offers both a visual GUI (based on PyQt) and a RESTful API.
- **Modular Encapsulation**: Facilitates quick integration with PACS/HIS and other medical information systems.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with Linux/Windows systems with CUDA acceleration optimizations.

## üìä Performance Metrics

| Evaluation Metric          | Test Result                          | Baseline Comparison |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Segmentation Accuracy (DSC)| 92.4% (Prostate MRI)                 | Unet: 90.8%         |
| Encryption Efficiency      | ‚â§0.8s per image (RTX3090)            | Paillier: 2.3s      |
| Attack Resilience          | Successfully defended against 10^6 FGSM simulated attacks | -                   |

## üèÜ Technical Breakthroughs
- **Algorithm Innovation**: The first medical AI framework to integrate attention mechanisms with LWE encryption.
- **Engineering Optimization**: Achieves parallel encryption/segmentation pipelines with a throughput of 58 FPS.
- **Clinical Validation**: Successfully passed POC testing in a top-tier hospital, reducing misdiagnosis rates by 19.7%.

## üñ• UI Module: Demonstration Interface

MedSecure-U provides a user-friendly graphical interface that enables seamless interaction with the underlying segmentation and encryption pipelines. The UI offers the following functionalities:

- **Interactive Visualization**: Display segmentation results alongside original medical images.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Monitor progress and receive immediate feedback during image processing.
- **Encryption Status**: Visual indicators show the encryption process and validation of data integrity.
